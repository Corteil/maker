Welcome to the Internet of Fish. 

In this project, we use three different files:

- temp.py
- data.php
- index.html

However, as the project goes on, temp.py transforms as we make changes. Reflecting that, there are three copies of temp.py as it looks in each chapter of the book section.

If you are skipping ahead to complete the finished project, temp_final.py is your pick.

If you have updates or suggestions for this project, I encourage you to submit a pull request. Thank you and good luck!
