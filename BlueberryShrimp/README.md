# "Blueberry Shrimp" Projects

This folder contains the example projects from the *Blueberry Shrimp* chapter of the Pi Intermediate Projects book.

The projects combine a Raspberry Pi with a **Shrimp**, (a reference implementation of a breadboarded Arduino-compatible circuit), and a Bluetooth serial module  as a foundation for a variety of different games and interactive multimedia systems.

Within the book, each sensor configuration is provided with full build instructions for both solderless breadboard and soldered copper stripboard, as well as Arduino code to run on the Shrimp
